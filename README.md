## Google Book Search Engine (Week #21 Challenge)

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of the MERN stack. Starter code used Restful API's which were reconfigured to use GraphQL. <a href="https://goldengayle.github.io/BookSearchEngine/">Link to Search Engine</a>

## How it was made
This project utilizes the MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express Server, React, Node).


## Optimizations
In the future,I would like to add more styling to this search engine. I would also add ratings to be rendered on the page as well. I would also like to deploy to heroku (for some reason my page doesn't render after being created)

## Lessons Learned
I learned alot about debugging through working through this challenges. When you are using a complex stack, the error messages aren't always as clear as I have grown accustommed to. I had to be very systematic about how to solve these issues and I even had to ask for help.

## Credits
